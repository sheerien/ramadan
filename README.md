# Ramadan 2025 Series Scraper

This script is designed to scrape Ramadan 2025 series from the website [https://wecima.watch/](https://wecima.watch/).

## Usage

### Step 1: Install Python 3.11 or Higher
Make sure you have Python 3.11 or a higher version installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### On macOS and Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Required Libraries
Install the necessary libraries by running the following command:


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Setting Up the Environment

## Create a `.env` File
1. Copy the contents of the `.env.example` file.
2. Paste them into a new file named `.env` in the same directory.

## Create an `output` Directory
1. Inside the `wecima` folder, create a new folder named `output`.

## Update Series URL
- When Ramadan 2025 series are available on the website, inside .env file update the series URL from `https://wecima.watch/` to the new link provided by the site.

Now your environment is set up and ready to use! ðŸš€
